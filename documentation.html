    <h2>Design Process</h2>

    <h3> Features</h3>
      <p> The design proess for this chart was more challenging than I intitially expected. 
        I wanted to make a chart that would show the price of the Nvidia stock over time, but a simple chart plotting that proved to have many problems.
        Then I changed the elements of the chart. Originally it was just a chart of the closing price over time, but I decided to make it into a candlestick chart instead, which is a type of chart used to show opening and closing prices on each day. 
        This also didn't work because I found it was too cluttered and hard to interpret. So I instead decided to make an interactive chart that allows the user to look at any aspect of the dataset they want
        The new chart was a line chart of the closing price over time by default, but using a dropdown the user could choose to look at opening price, the high and low values, and the volume of shares traded on that day.
