    <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p> The design proess for this chart was more challenging than I intitially expected. 
        I wanted to make a chart that would show the price of the Nvidia stock over time, but a simple chart plotting that proved to have many problems.
        The first iteration of the chart was very ugly, it was too small, and it didn't do a good job of representing the data. 
      The first thing i changed was mkaing it larger so it was easy to look at the graph. I chose to make it take up basically the whole screen as it will be the only chart on screen, so the space isn't needed for other things.
