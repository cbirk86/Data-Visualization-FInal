        This was much better, as it allows the user to look at the information of their choosing. This also had problems because the stock value grew exponentially over time, so the earlier years were impossible to distinguish as a result.
        To fix this I made the y axis scale logarithmically, to better show the increases over time. This didn't work for everything, for example volume, so I decided to add a drop down that allows the user to choose between logarithmic and linear scaling for the y axis.
