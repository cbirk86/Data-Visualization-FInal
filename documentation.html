    <h2>Design Process</h2>

    <h3> Features</h3>
      <p> The design proess for this chart was more challenging than I intitially expected. 
        I wanted to make a chart that would show the price of the Nvidia stock over time, but a simple chart plotting that proved to have many problems.
        Then I changed the elements of the chart. Originally it was just a chart of the closing price over time, but I decided to make it into a candlestick chart instead, which is a type of chart used to show opening and closing prices on each day. 
        This also didn't work because I found it was too cluttered and hard to interpret. So I instead decided to make an interactive chart that allows the user to look at any aspect of the dataset they want
        The new chart was a line chart of the closing price over time by default, but using a dropdown the user could choose to look at opening price, the high and low values, and the volume of shares traded on that day.
        This was much better, as it allows the user to look at the information of their choosing. This also had problems because the stock value grew exponentially over time, so the earlier years were impossible to distinguish as a result.
        To fix this I made the y axis scale logarithmically, to better show the increases over time. This didn't work for everything, for example volume, so I decided to add a drop down that allows the user to choose between logarithmic and linear scaling for the y axis.
        The final feature I added was a year select feature. This let the user select a starting and ending year for the chart, so they can look at more specific time periods and compare them if they want to.
      </p>

    <h3> Design Choices</h3>
      <p>
        When I finished making the chart, it was very ugly. It was just a black line on a white background with unlabeled axes. The first thing I did to fix this was add labels to the axes to make this easier to understand.
        Then, I changed the color of the line in the chart to be lime green. This is because lime green is the primary color of Nvidia, and I thought it would be fitting for the chart to subtly convey that.
        I also changed the background of the chart to a grey, as grey is a main color of Nvidia as well.
        I thought about changing the font but I didn't like any of the font options and the more I think about it the better I think the default font looks.
        I decided to limit the amount of years on the chart to every other to make it less cluttered.
        To pair with this, I also made vertical lines coming from each year label to better reference where a certain spot on the chart is compared to the year.
        I thought about doing this for the y axis too and found that it just made it needlessly cluttered and was harder to implement.

    <h3> Questions Explored</h3>
      <p>
        The main question I wanted to explore with this visualization is how the stock price of Nvidia has changed over time.
        THis was fascinating as the growth of the stock started out very slowly for the first few years, and then started booming. I believe the reason for this to be the explosion is AI technology and how important Nvidia as a company is for that
        Another question I had was how much variation a stock's opening and closing price, and high and low prices had on a given day
        By zooming into a 1 year period I was able to check this and compare to find that there really isn't much variation in these over a time period.
        I also wanted to see how the volume of stocks traded over time. 
        I was able to do this by using linear scaling and looking at the volume option, and I found that most days had hundreds of millions of Nvidia stocks traded, with many having billions.
        This is fascinating as I had no idea there could be that many trades of a single stock on each day. 
        The last thing I wanted to check was if the amount of stocks traded on a day corresponding to anything to do with the price.
        Using the visualization I was able to find that on days with notable highs or lows in the stock prices, there tended to be an uptick in shares traded.
